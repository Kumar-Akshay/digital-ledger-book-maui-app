# DesiKhata App - Icon & Brand Guidelines

## App Icon
The app icon has been customized with a green background (#2e7d32) and a white rupee symbol foreground. The icon represents the app's focus on financial management with an Indian context.

## Splash Screen
The splash screen features:
- Green background (#2e7d32)
- White circular center
- Red rupee symbol (#c62828)
- App name: "DESI KHATA"
- Tagline: "Digital Ledger System"

## Color Palette
The app uses a consistent color scheme across all elements:

### Primary Colors
- **Primary Green** (#2e7d32) - Used for app background, headers, and positive balances
- **Dark Green** (#005005) - Used for darker UI elements and accents
- **Red** (#c62828) - Used for "You Gave" transactions and negative balances

### UI Color Meanings
- **Green** - Represents money coming in (You Got)
- **Red** - Represents money going out (You Gave)

## Typography
The app uses the default system fonts with the following styles:
- Headings: Bold, sized appropriately for hierarchy
- Body text: Regular weight for readability
- Financial figures: Semi-bold for emphasis

## In-App Branding
The app includes a custom-designed logo that appears on the main page:
- Ledger book styling with horizontal lines
- Red rupee symbol (â‚¹) 
- Green background representing financial growth

## Implementation Notes
- The icon and splash screen are implemented using SVG files
- The app title has been updated to "DesiKhata" (without "App" suffix)
- The app identifier is set to "com.desikhata.app"
- All brand colors are defined in Resources/Styles/Colors.xaml
- Android-specific colors are defined in Platforms/Android/Resources/values/colors.xml

## Future Improvements
- Create high-resolution PNG versions of the logo for platforms that don't support SVG
- Design additional brand assets for marketing materials
- Create a style guide for consistent UI development
